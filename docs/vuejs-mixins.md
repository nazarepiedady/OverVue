# Mixins

Mixins are a way to avoid having to duplicate logic across components. With Mixins, you can define a "small" chunk of logic outside of a component in a `.js` file and import that into any component in your app. In other words, Mixins are here to make your code across components DRY. You can use any component options ( data, methods, lifecycle hooks...)
