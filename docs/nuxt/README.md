Nuxt is a front end JavaScript framework based on Vue.js. It is used to create "Universal Application", which means utilizing the Vue.js single file component system to create web views in JavaScipt and that can function both as SPA (Single Page Application) or SSR (Server Side Render).
Just like for the Vue section. This Nuxt section of Overvue.dev covers some of Nuxt's core concepts for learning purposes and overall just a quick access to some Nuxt snippets you might need while building apps with Nuxt.js.
