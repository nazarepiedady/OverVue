## Learn JavaScript

If you are trying seriously learn JavaScript, I'll advice **[this excellent 50+ hour course](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-the-complete-guide-2020-beginner-advanced/)** by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. His VueJS course is also excellent. Both course, and more are available on [Academind.com](https://academind.com/).
