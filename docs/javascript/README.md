# A JavaScript Overview

This section covers some core JavaScript needed for Vue Developers, but also things you may have forgotten, and overall just a quick access to JavaScript snippets you might need while building a Vue.js app. I won't be focusing on DOM manipulation as Vue.js should be do the heavy lifting there.

## Learning JavaScript

This section will not be suitable to learn Javascript from scratch but can help you find commonly use core concept. It's aimed at Vue developers that might have jumped in Vue without a really solid JavaScript experience.
If you are seriously trying learn JavaScript, I'll advise **[this detailled and excellent course](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-the-complete-guide-2020-beginner-advanced/)** by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. His VueJS course is also excellent. Both are available on his website [Academind.com](https://academind.com/). John Resig, Bear Bibeault, and Josip Maras's, [The Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja](https://www.manning.com/books/secrets-of-the-javascript-ninja) is a great, eye-opening, JS book, that I love to recommend to anyone working with JavaScript.
