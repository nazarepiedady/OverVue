# A JavaScript Overview

I thought it would be useful to create a JavaScript section as well.
This section covers some more or less basic JavaScript needed for Vue Developers, things you may have forgotten, and overall just a quick access to JavaScript snippets you also need while building a Vue.js app.

## Learn JavaScript

If you are trying seriously learn JavaScript, I'll advise **[this detailled and excellent course](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-the-complete-guide-2020-beginner-advanced/)** by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. His VueJS course is also excellent. Both are available on his website [Academind.com](https://academind.com/).
