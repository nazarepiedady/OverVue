# VuePress

Since this very website was made using VuePress.vue, I am including those commands.

## Install globally

```shell
yarn global add vuepress # OR npm install -g vuepress
```

## Install as a local dependency

```shell
yarn add -D vuepress # OR npm install -D vuepress
```

## Run Local Server

```shell
yarn docs:dev
```

[localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)

## Build for production

```shell
yarn docs:build
```

[See the official VuePress doc](https://v1.vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/getting-started.html)
