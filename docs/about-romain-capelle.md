## Shoutouts

To my friend Ted for introducing me to Vue and getting me started with it.

I also wanted to thank Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller for [his amazing course on Vue and Vuex](https://acad.link/vuejs) that you can also find on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/).
I would advise any newcomers to the world of Vue.js to get a look at his tutorials.

John Resig, Bear Bibeault, and Josip Maras's, The [Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja](https://www.manning.com/books/secrets-of-the-javascript-ninja-second-edition) is a great, eye-opening, JS book, that I love to recommend to anyone working with JavaScript.
